# Challenges of Learning ASP.Net Core

I have never known web dev before. I comes from a background of C# and Desktop application. Web Apps are new to me, and this posts a problem in learning ASP.Net Core.

So far as I can tell, the entire ASP.net Core is designed to suit those who are already familiar with Web Dev, in the sense that they know how to deal with html, CSS, and JavaScript, they know how http requests work, how routing works, how a web server handles these sort of requests, how index work how request methods work, even sockets, hook, all that fancy stuff.

Coming from a realm with zero knowledge on web dev, I find these concepts difficult to digest.

But slowly and surely, learning by cross referencing the different text book and references, I'm sure I can build up a robust understanding of the ASP.Net Core framework.

# Solutions

I find most programming learning experience to be a scary at first glance. Textbooks tend to have this habit of overexplaining concepts that are intuitively simple. Take for example the delegates and events in C#, the textbook first go on length about what subscribers and broadcasters are, and how they interact, etc., etc. But as you read the code, the mechanism is quite self explanatory and simple. An event is raised at some point in the object, and you can attach functions to the event delegate so that when it is raised the function will execute. Once you understand how it works there is no need to verbally remember the complexity.

**Read what the code is doing, and then the textbook** become a first principal of my experience. The textbook paragraphs are just supplements once you understand what the code is doing, it clarifies the unclear points. But only if you understand what the code is doing the textbook becomes easy to understand or even makes any sort of sense at all.
